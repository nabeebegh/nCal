# *nCal* ~ My Personal Project

## A minimalist calendar program.

**nCal** is a simple and easy to use calendar program inspired by the
several calendar applications that allow millions of people to navigate their days in an
organized manner. Like those applications, nCal will have an easy to use interface that will
present users with a full calendar in which they can enter events, reminders, and daily to-do lists.
Furthermore, users will be able to set alarms or alerts for when they wanted to be reminded about their entries.
In short, the goal of this program is to provide the end user with the absolute necessities needed for a calendar program,
without the added bloatware and confusion that is present on other calendar software. In short, the goal of **nCal** is to be a
minimalist calendar.

The target end users for **nCal** are those who only needs the basics from a calendar software; without any of the extra features
or confusing interfaces that are only used by advanced users. If someone needs to keep track of the events coming up in their life in the simplest way, **nCal** is for them!

*Developer Note: My interest in this project came from my experience with several calendar applications I have used that had too much going on
for a user like me that only needed to use the most necessary features.*
